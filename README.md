# R3ASC 2018 Tutorial
## Introduction to optimization of actuation systems with open-source tools 

Abstract:   
The tutorial concerns the use of open-source tools such as python, python scientific libraries, python notebooks in order to realize the preliminary design of electromechanical actuators in the field of aerospace. The tutorial will show how : to represent datasheet catalogs, FEM simulation using scaling laws or surrogate models, to model transient mission with transfer functions models, to associate models in order to size and optimize the overall system with easy to use python packages. There are no specific requirements in simulation or programming for understanding and achieving the tutorial.
